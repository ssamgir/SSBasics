#Model View Controller Design Pattern




###View: The View is responsible for displaying the data on the screen from the Controller and receiving user gestures and relaying that back to the Controller.

###Controller: The Controller is responsible for updating and retrieving information from the Model and handles user interaction from the View.

###Model: The Model is responsible for retrieving the data from whatever data sources that powers the app (database, feeds etc).
